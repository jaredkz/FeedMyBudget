## DEVELOPMENT RELEASE

I'll populate this properly later, but I want to create a way to use a database online and offline, online-only for web. To do this, all operations seem to require async for web support with Drift, so that is implemented.

# Version 0.3
- Using Drift for databases
- Using Flutter Modular for dependency injection and state management.
- Navigation loads home, keeps navigation as a scaffold, so even if the page errors out, you still have access to the navigation.
- Modules/pages added: Cart; placeholders: profile;

## Changes

There will likely be plenty of changes that will not be covered in detail by the changelog as this project is going to be in active development.
