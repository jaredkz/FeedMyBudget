## DEVELOPMENT RELEASE

I'll populate this properly later, but I want to create a way to use a database online and offline, online-only for web. To do this, all operations seem to require async for web support with Drift, so that is implemented.

# Version 0.4
- Temporarily removed databases to adjust navigation before the 0.5 dev releas.
- Navigation is now fixed, assuming pages should not error out as we only have closed navigation currently.
- Navigation now separates all modules and loads them individually so child navigation can be used within these modules.



# Version 0.3
- Using Drift for databases
- Using Flutter Modular for dependency injection and state management.
- Modules/pages added: Cart; placeholders: profile;

## Changes

There will likely be plenty of changes that will not be covered in detail by the changelog as this project is going to be in active development.
